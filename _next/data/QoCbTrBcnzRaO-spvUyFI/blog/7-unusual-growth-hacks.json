To help your business thrive, consider these seven unconventional, yet highly practical growth hacks that will capture the attention of guests and keep them coming back.\n\n## 1. Strategic Partnerships with Local Businesses\nWhy not extend the value you offer guests by partnering with local businesses? Think beyond traditional amenities and create unique experiences. For example, collaborate with a local tour operator to offer exclusive guided tours or team up with a nearby restaurant to offer a \"dine-and-stay\" package. This not only enriches the guest experience but also helps you tap into the networks of local businesses, boosting visibility and brand awareness.\n\n**Example:** A holiday rental in the Swiss Alps partnered with local ski schools to provide discounted lessons for guests booking extended stays, increasing both bookings and customer satisfaction.\n\n## 2. Offering Unique Accommodations\nPeople love to stay somewhere extraordinary. Airbnb’s collaboration with iconic brands like Barbie's Malibu Dream House or a house from Friends shows the power of unique accommodations. Offering a one-of-a-kind experience could set your property apart from competitors and make it the talk of social media.\n\n**Example:** A beachside property turned into a 'luxury pirate ship' experience for guests seeking something truly unique, gaining viral attention on social media.\n\n## 3. Leverage a “Co-Working Stay” Package for Digital Nomads\nWith remote work becoming more common, digital nomads are constantly on the lookout for places that blend work and leisure. Offer a \"Co-Working Stay\" package that includes access to local co-working spaces or provide high-speed internet and quiet workspaces at your property. By marketing your property as a “remote working getaway,” you can attract long-term stays, providing flexibility for guests who want to work while exploring a new destination.\n\n**Example:** A property in Bali offered a ‘workcation’ package with daily access to a beachfront co-working space, attracting digital nomads from around the world.\n\n## 4. Collaborate with Travel Bloggers to Curate Custom Experiences\nInstead of just offering travel bloggers free stays, take it a step further. Collaborate with them to design bespoke experiences that appeal to their audience. Whether it’s an off-the-beaten-path adventure or a local cultural immersion, this personalized touch gives bloggers a reason to share the experience with their followers.\n\n**Example:** A mountain retreat partnered with a popular hiking blogger to create a custom trail package that was only available to those booking through the blogger’s content, drawing in new guests from the blogger’s loyal following.\n\n## 5. Integrate Your Property into Unique Local Events\nTapping into local events like festivals, marathons, or cultural celebrations can add value to a guest’s experience. Offer packages that are specifically designed around these events, such as early check-ins before a major festival or transportation to an exclusive event. This strategy lets you charge a premium while offering a seamless and memorable experience for your guests.\n\n**Example:** A city-center property tied its bookings with a local food festival, offering exclusive tickets, transport, and a private chef experience, resulting in a surge of bookings during the event season.\n\n## 6. Create a “Mystery Stay” Booking Option\nAdd an element of surprise and excitement to your bookings by introducing a \"Mystery Stay\" option. Guests don’t know exactly where they’re staying until they book, but they receive clues leading up to their reservation. Add an unexpected bonus, like a free spa treatment or helicopter tour, to make the experience even more thrilling. This playful approach can build anticipation and increase bookings, especially during off-peak seasons.\n\n**Example:** A resort in the Caribbean created a \"Secret Paradise\" package where guests didn’t know which exclusive island they’d be staying on until their booking was confirmed, leading to buzz and increased interest.\n\n## 7. Host Exclusive Events for Repeat Guests\nTurn first-time guests into loyal customers by hosting exclusive, invite-only events. A “Guest Appreciation Weekend” with local food, entertainment, and special discounts for future bookings creates a sense of community and makes your guests feel valued. These events can serve as powerful word-of-mouth marketing, encouraging guests to share their experiences and return for future stays.\n\n**Example:** A luxury cabin in the mountains organized a special \"Winter Escape\" event for returning guests, offering them discounted future bookings and creating a loyal customer base.\n\n**Bonus:** Gamify the Booking Experience\nGamifying the booking process can turn a simple transaction into a fun, engaging activity. Offer limited-time treasure hunts or mystery deals where customers can unlock discounts or special perks by engaging with your property’s social media or booking within certain time frames. This creates urgency and excitement, increasing bookings and engagement.\n\n**Example:** A boutique hotel in Paris offered a scavenger hunt with clues hidden on its Instagram page, with each clue leading to a special discount for followers who booked within a limited timeframe.\n\n**Let’s Hear From You!**\n\nWhich of these growth hacks would you be willing to try for your own holiday rental business?
